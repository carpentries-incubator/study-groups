## Icebreakers

A group facilitator should also lead an ice breaker for each session.
This gives the participants a chance to get more comfortable with one another and talking in the discussion session.
Ideally, the icebreaker shouldn't take more than 10 min.

Some possible icebreakers include:
- What is your favorite icebreaker question? (this is quite meta, maybe better left for later in the round...)
- How do you feel about snow?
- If you could learn a new skill/domain instantly "matrix-style", what would you choose and why?
- If you could have the power of teleportation right now, where would you go and why?
- What is one nice thing that happened to you this week? Or what are you looking forward to about next week?
- See the [icebreakers in the Instructor Training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/icebreakers/index.html) for more options.

## Ending Each Session

At the end of each session, a group facilitator should remind the participants
to provide minute card feedback.
