## Before the Session

Before the session, the group facilitator should remind the Discussion Lead to 
leave time (5-10 min) for discussion of the homework for next session at the end
of the call.


## Beginning Each Session

One of the group facilitators should introduce each session by welcoming participants, reminding them
of the Code of Conduct, and doing an icebreaker (more below).

### Icebreakers

A group facilitator should lead an ice breaker for each session.
This gives the participants a chance to get more comfortable with one another and talking in the discussion session.
Ideally, the icebreaker shouldn't take more than 10 min.

Some possible icebreakers include:
- What is your favorite icebreaker question? (this is quite meta, maybe better left for later in the round...)
- How do you feel about snow?
- If you could learn a new skill/domain instantly "matrix-style", what would you choose and why?
- If you could have the power of teleportation right now, where would you go and why?
- What is one nice thing that happened to you this week? Or what are you looking forward to about next week?
- See the [icebreakers in the Instructor Training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/icebreakers/index.html) for more options.
