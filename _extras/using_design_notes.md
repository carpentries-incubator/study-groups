title: Using the Lesson Design Notes Template
---

[The lesson design notes template is available as a CodiMD document][ldn-template-codimd].

## Copying the Template

Follow the steps below to create a copy of the template for your own lesson,
in a few different formats.

### CodiMD/HackMD/HedgeDoc/Markdown

To create a copy in Markdown, open the "edit" view of the template
(click on the pencil symbol near the top-left of the page)
and select and copy all the text.
You can then paste this into another CodiMD/HedgeDoc/HackMD document,
or save it as a text file on your local system.
Note that using the template as a local file,
you will not be able to use the GraphViz functionality to draw concept maps
within the document.
This feature is provided by the CodiMD platform,
and is not integrated with Markdown by default.

### GoogleDocs

To create a copy in GoogleDocs or an equivalent,
open the rendered "view" of the CodiMD
(click on the eye symbol near the top-left of the page)
and select and copy all the text.
You can then paste this into a new document.
The concept map will not copy across,
and you will need to delete the contents of that section.
Options to include concept maps in your design notes on GoogleDocs include:

- choose "Insert" -> "Drawing" and draw your map/add one already saved as a drawing in your Google Drive
- draw the map with some other software, save it as an image, and upload/insert it into the GoogleDoc that way
- draw the concept map on a piece of paper, take a photo of it, and insert that photo into the GoogleDoc

## Adding the Template to Your Lesson Pages

The lesson design notes can be added to your lesson website by saving the file
(as Markdown and including the YAML header)
into the `_extras` folder.
Note that GraphViz is not currently supported by the lesson template,
so any concept maps you have drawn will not be displayed in
the built lesson pages.
Consider creating equivalents to these concept maps in a vector graphics format
(e.g. SVG) if you plan to include your design notes in the lesson itself.
We hope that future versions of the lesson template will
support maps created with GraphViz.
