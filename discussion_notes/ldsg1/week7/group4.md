## Agenda

1. Welcome & Icebreaker 
    - If you could "Matrix-style" become an expert in something overnight, what would you choose, and why?
        - Kate: Has PhD in plant biology, but wants to become an expert in growing plants (ie green thumb).
        - Jon: Flying with a wing suit!
        - Alex: Geology 
        - Fan: Too many things! Good at sports, but not soo good with sports that involve balls. So being an expert in ball sports
        - Rhonda: Drawing. 
        - Yuka: Kung-fu
    - Kate: What resources do you need to practice or pilot your lesson? Let's use this time to continue to push your development forward
2. What feedback do you plan to collect from your learners during the trial run? Is there a particular aspect of your episode that you hope to gather feedback on? (what questions to ask, and how to receive that feedback)
    - Kate: Thinking between do I want a friendly audience that I know or do I want to get the "public" involved who are attracted to the advertised workshop? If you're not ready to pilot test yet: what are some outstanding questions do you have for the material you are developing?
    - Jon: Trail run next week 20-30 mins of [content](https://codimd.carpentries.org/2021-03-26-2300-ldsg1-group4-session7?both). Hope to get feedback on "Is it too much at one time?". What is missing in terms of foundational information? Learning both tools + data and balancing the amount of material covering each. Collecting anonymous sticky note feedback via [Jam Board](https://jamboard.google.com)
    - Alex: https://miro.com or https://www.mural.co (similar tools, sound the same, too)
    - Fan: Haven't received formal instructor training yet, but will have close friends to participate in pilot. Content isn't complicated but pre-req will be basic coding background. But what would participants "background" will be is still a mystery. During the lesson, when would participants become demotivated? Whats too hard? When do I lose traction?
    - Kate: Internally I've been worried the context I am talking about is too boring, but the pacing of introduction of material matters in terms of keeping audience attention/interest. Similar to Jon's concern about "what is too much material"? Maybe prepare more material?
    - Yuka: regarding too much vs not enough material, not being able to cover it all is normal, and is very audience dependent. As you teach lessons over again, you get a better idea of the average duration. Mixed audiences will require you to slow down. Use periodic check-ins, especially at the beginning, to be sure you're not losing anyone struggling initially. Can slow down to make sure you don't lose anyone. Good strategy is to know the bare minimum of what you'd like to cover, and have a bit extra if there is time.
    - Jon: That is similar to the kind of advise I gave: Go through the exercise and think about what are the content you need to focus on to be able to follow the rest of the lesson.
    - Kate: How to gather feedback from Kate. Difficult to get engagement while teaching remotely. Quiet zoom room, dififculty to get people to unmute. For those who use sticky notes, what are the pros and cons from getting feed back from those who are lagging behind?
    - Fan: First few mins in the lesson scheduling a break and screen sharing to help. 
    - Kate: Setting expectations for potentially using screen share to help troubleshoot. 
    - Yuka: Get folks to turn on the camera. 

4. How will you and your helper(s) work together during and after the trial run?
    - Kate: Do you need or want a helper? 
    - Alex: Maybe? Trying to get folks to become maintainers for the lesson / and possibly teaching it. Perhaps gathering folks from the local Carpentries list.
    - Fan: Better to have a back up person in case something happens (in-person). 
    - Kate: Having a "tech support"/observer in case something unexpected happens or for recruitment purposes. NZ workshop kept meeting during after shocks from an earth quake. 
    - Jon: Would like to have a co-teacher to off load responsibility and collaborative. But right now it feel like it would be too much of a burden for the other person. Always happy to wait for someone to speak up.
    - Kate: Keep moving while waiting for folks to speak up to make sure folks don't think you're frozen! 
    - Fan: Was in a session with strangers but music helps. 
    - Kate: Some auditory might be nice but also challenging for some. 
    - Alex: Felt too easy when having lots of helpers. How do you de-center facilitation responsibilities. 
6. It is preferable not to teach alone. If you are the sole representative of your lesson in the Study Group, how will your preparations for teaching differ compared to what you do as a member of an instructor team?
7. How long do you expect it will take to teach your trial run of a single episode?
9. What do you expect will be challenging?
    - Fan: I am designing material for a virtual audience. What do instructors need to be able to teach my lesson? 
    - Kate: Has similar questions on a different project. Materials appear online so both participants and instructors can have access. But its okay to cater toward one or another. Structuring material that is cohesive for beginners, and don't need to accomodate everyone (at this stage). What kind of tone/voice do you intend to use? Are you focusing on how instructors / participants would read your material?
    - Jon: Python doc is dry, but carpentries is more down to earth. It's generic. Tone: "This is what is is and how to do it" documentation style. 
    - Kate: Write materials for yourself and how you would teach it. You have the expetise and knowledge that is worth sharing.
10. What are you looking forward to about the trial run?
    - Alex: Looking forward to finally writing it out (has lots of notes at the moment)
    - Jon: Excited to seeing what goes wrong. Going from chaos to chaos. Opportunity to learn from those events. Thinking about how to navigate through those problems. 
    - Fan: Getting a chance to see what goes well. Trial run will give me certainty that the lesson is a feasible deliverable. 
    - Kate: Excited for everyone :) 
    - Alex: Lots of responsibility and challenge to develop a lesson. 
12.  homework (**Remember there is no call next week.**):
    - (ALL) If you have not already done so, complete a review of the episode you were assigned.
    - (ALL) Coordinate with the helper(s) you recruited for your Trial Run, to ensure they are prepared to support you in teaching and collecting feedback.
    - (ALL) In a scheduled “Trial Run,” teach (at least) one episode of your lesson.
    - (ALL) Open issues on your lesson repository to record the required changes to your lesson that were identified during/after the trial run.
    - (ALL) Before the Study Group next meets, reflect on [the discussion prompts for the next session](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/study-groups/09-reflecting/).
