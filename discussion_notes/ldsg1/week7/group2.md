## Agenda

### Welcome & Icebreaker 
1. What's your favorite season and what do you like about it?

- Colin: Summer - I like being warm, having long days and seeing trees/plants being green. Although warmth is not gauranteed in the UK.
- Tuomas: Winter - When there's lots of snow and ice and you can go skiing, skating and swimming!
- Toby: Autumn/Fall/Herbst - all the leaves changing colour on the trees on the hillside next to our apartment; Pfefferlinge (Chanterelle mushrooms) for cooking and eating; and an end to the Heidelberg summer, which tends to have temperatures much too high for my British sensibilities!
- Aleks: spring - all the greenery coming out and the smells and not too hot (I suppose May is the ideal month for me)
- Peter: summer - but it is a love hate relationship; the sole core reason for love is sandals or flipflops
- Maria: late sring because there is a summer vibe but is it normally not too hote. Also Summer in London is about 2 days around May, so that would be late spring ([name=Toby]: üòÜ). Enjoying the sun.
- Mos√®: summer - going to the sea
- Sue: winter because I love playing in snow and ice

### Preparing to Teach

1. What feedback do you plan to collect from your learners during the trial run? Is there a particular aspect of your episode that you hope to gather feedback on?
- Mos√®: the pace of the lesson, the level of details, and clarity in general
- Sue: I want to know what works for them and what doesn't. I also want to know if they feel that the training is at the appropriate level for them.
    - free-text responses: what worked? what didn't work?  what can be improved?
- Colin: how long it will take to teach, I can never estimate this accurately and have to measure it when teaching it.
    - Aleks: they're piloting new lessons, measuring how long excerices take.  Important to have someone among the helpers to measure the time the lesson take
- Maria what is was easy to take and what is not. How in depth I need to go explaining the data structures I am planing to teach.
- Tuomas: Focus on content more than delivery, try to identify where the expert gaps are
- Peter: thinking about this today, I'd be most interested in hearing if my content makes sense (based on this, I'd estimate time)
    - In Sue's experience, it's common that the question "was the lesson clear and understandable?" scores low.  You need to keep practising
    - the post-workshop survey can be found [here](https://carpentries.github.io/assessment-archives/post-workshop/post-workshop.html) @Sue: please check if that is the right link.
- Aleks: a big table where we tried to capture the timings of episodes and exercises at a recent pilot workshop where we tested some newly developed materials, starting from line 48: https://codimd.carpentries.org/RIvuDoIpRa62F5FUpnC3Tw?both
- Aleks: we are just in the middle of piloting brand new material on intermediate software development skills for the first time and here are some questions we prerared to ask our "testers":
    - Does the course teach the skills you would expect to learn in an intermediate computational skills course? e.g. Are there any topics missing? Are there any things missing from the existing material that should also be taught?
    - To what extent is the material effective at teaching skills that are useful for researchers? Do you have any suggestions for how to improve the material?
    - The course is designed to be delivered online with learners largely self-learning, following the materials in teams of 4 or 5 separated into Zoom rooms. Is this appropriate given the content, or are there places in the material where a greater instructor-led element is needed? What do you think the balance should be?
    - Since the course is currently subject to review and change we haven't yet created any supporting media such as instructor video introductions to the lessons at this stage. To what extent do you think introductory videos would improve the quality of learning for this course? What do you think they should cover for intermediate learners to introduce a topic in general?
    - What do you think are the skills that would be useful in a follow-on advanced course? Should this be a generalised or specialised course, or a mix of both?
    - General Feedback: Feel free to add any other thoughts on the material here.
    - Feedback on pilot workshop: Have you found the format of this pilot workshop effective in reviewing the material? What could be improved?




2. How will you and your helper(s) work together during and after the trial run?

- Colin: I still need to recruit helpers, assuming I have some I will do a pre-trial briefing with them, ask them to read/review the material and then do a post-trial debrief to discuss and record any issues. Preferably doing this straight after the workshop so its fresh in our minds.
    - Tuomas: the trial run will be very brief, probably no need for a real helper in the usual sense.  They would be more someone overlooking how the lesson is going and mesure the time
- Peter: help to remove impediments for the learners (software versions, error messages, ...), give feedback during class if exercises contain confusing questions etc.; no helpers in my case as well
- Maria: I need to organize with my helper. I am planing to have a pre-test dry run with him and get feedback also from that test. In the real dry test I hope he can take feedback notes
- Mos√®: take notes of how the lesson is going and have a debrief afterwards to discuss what to improve, what worked
- Sue: we will follow the [recommended roles for virtual Carpentries training](https://carpentries.org/online-workshop-recommendations/#instructional-team-roles-who-what-when) (technical helper, facilitating and document helpers, breakout room helper)
    - https://carpentries.org/online-workshop-recommendations/#instructional-team-roles-who-what-when
- Aleks: I often have a blind spot (having worked with experienced Carpentry community members - instructors and helpers) and assume helpers will know what to do - having a pre-workshop debrief to go through the plan can help with that to explain the roles and expectations.
- Aleks: also setting time aside after the workshop is important to reflect and for any post-workshop actions (and sometimes with busy work lives - I tend to forget to set aside enough time for me and the team to do that) - this is in particual important for lesson develoment while the feedback and impressions from the pilot are still fresh in your minds

3. It is preferable not to teach alone. If you are the sole representative of your lesson in the Study Group, how will your preparations for teaching differ compared to what you do as a member of an instructor team?
- Tuomas: Teaching in a team of 2. We can focus on the parts we are more familiar with. Also want to try the recap of what the previous person taught so will have to divide into smaller parts.
- Sue: I would not attempt to teach alone. A single technical problem from one person forces you to make a difficult choice: do you stop teaching  attend to the one person, effectively ignoring everyone else? Or do you ignore the one person in order to continue teaching? It's a bad situation to be in.
- Mos√®: will teach in a team.  I think it's interesting to see the different approaches and learn from each other
- Maria I am planing to teach as a team of 2. 
- Colin: I've had to teach alone before due to not having a budget for helpers or helpers familiar with the material. I tend to limit class sizes to about 5-7 people if I do this. If required I run workshops multiple times. More time has to be left for exercises since you are the helper. It works best when the group is evenly matched.
- Aleks: in the case you have to teach your pilot episode alone: be aware that things will take longer as you will have to note the timings and facilitate the room yourself - which would be really hard on you as an instructor even for a small room. If you are alone - make sure the group you are teaching to is small, only a few people.
- Peter: if I'd have to do it alone, I'd go for a flipped classroom setup


4. How long do you expect it will take to teach your trial run of a single episode?
- Peter: "7+2 things" long ... estimates are hard
- Colin: introduction + setup + teaching + exercises + feedback + helper debrief
- Sue: 75 minutes instruction plus 40 minutes for exercises; generous timings because I think we'll need the time and I don't want to rush through it or leave anything out.
- Maria: 30 min for the dry-test chapter.

One up, one down: ask participants to alternate

5. What are you looking forward to about the trial run and/or what do you expect will be challenging?
-

### Homework (**Remember there is no call next week.**):
1. (ALL) If you have not already done so, complete a review of the episode you were assigned.
2. (ALL) Coordinate with the helper(s) you recruited for your Trial Run, to ensure they are prepared to support you in teaching and collecting feedback.
3. (ALL) In a scheduled ‚ÄúTrial Run,‚Äù teach (at least) one episode of your lesson.
4. (ALL) Open issues on your lesson repository to record the required changes to your lesson that were identified during/after the trial run.
5. (ALL) Before the Study Group next meets, reflect on [the discussion prompts for the next session](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/study-groups/09-reflecting/).
