## Agenda

1. Welcome & Icebreaker 
    - The 2020s have not started well. If you could live in another decade until the 2030s start, which decade would you choose and why?

- [name= Nora] I love this decade, and I don't want to switch it with another decade.
- [name=Joni] I vote to stay the same as Nora, this decade is better than any previous decade.
- [name=Mike] Last decade was pretty good 
- [name=Mateusz] Probably something in the future, but before the Earth is inhabitable, maybe we explore things that can save Earth
- [name=Dave] I'd go back to the [1980s](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/09/Winamp1.006.PNG).
- [name=batool] I'd go back to before I was born in 1990.
- [name=Daniel] mid 90s for the GUIs
- [name=Toby] late 1980s to late 1990s; move to Seattle and buy a flannel shirt

2. What feedback do you plan to collect from your learners during the trial run? Is there a particular aspect of your episode that you hope to gather feedback on?

- [name= Elnaz] I am looking for how understandable is the lesson technically and I would like to know how wide the audiences could be. Because if the material is understandable for a biologist, even if they have not much info about the lesson, they would be able to start to do the analysis which I am teaching. 
- [name=Mike] I think I'm most interested in timing -- which sections to spend more time on, and which sections don't need as much depth‚Äîalso, feedback on how the challenge activities worked with the content.
- [name=Daniel] A little bit on how the content should best be delivered. At the moment, I'm worried I've focused too much on the content as something to read and not enough on the material as something that will be delivered 'live'. I am also keen to see how well the exercises/discussions go and whether they are useful or too broad. I also would love to get some suggestions for examples, things that are missing or assumptions I've made that I shouldn't have.
- [name=Joni] I will be teaching in-person and using a standard form within our department.  Teaching a different variant to Motorsports students (Geopandas race deconstruction), I want to gauge engagement and complexity level.  Where do I start to lose them.
- [name= Batool] I want to get feedback from the Bioconductor team about the dataset, the structure and the flow of the lesson. We are also hoping to get feedback from PhD students with no background about RNA-seq about the pacing of the lesson. 
- [name=Nora] I hope to get feedback as to whether or not I'm missing any key messages in my topic area and will really hope to get good examples from the GLAM sector that I'm missing at the moment. And of course whether or not the content of my episode is pitched at the right level for my target audience! Same as Daniel too, I've written it in such a way that it can be followed without an instructor...so will be interesting to see how well it works then teaching to it live. 
- [name=Mark] The level and whether the analogies for what are abstract mathematical processes work


3. How will you and your helper(s) work together during and after the trial run?

- [name= Elnaz] Helpers are important because they already know what is going on and what are the results and how to solve the issue (hopefully). In the teaching lesson, I hope they can help with data and coding issues. 
- [name=Mike] Helpers will be really important for facilitating breakout rooms, and Zoom logistics. Also, posting links and answering questions in the chat.
- [name=Nora] I'm hoping helpers in my lesson will be able to field technical but also subject related questions in the chat, which will also be useful for analysing later. Also, thinking helpers will be great for synthesising learning outcomes. Also agree with Daniel, ha! From now on I'm going to just let him write my comments ;P 
- [name= Mark] It's difficult to deliver material and keep an eye on reactions and questions, so a helper will be essential to monitor the chat and keep watch for raised hands. They can also answer questions and feedback, whether I need to slow down or reiterate anything. 
- [name=Joni] No helper, unfortunately, due to in-person teaching restrictions. I won't be using Zoom, it'll be an in-person session. Networking is important for the learning experience 
- [name=Daniel] I am hoping that between the other people working on this lesson we can try and spot some trends in what people find useful and how the pacing is working. It will also be a useful opportunity to try and see how the pieces of each episode fit together (or don't) and if we need additional linkage between each section. Hopefully, we can also offload the practical zoom details to make the presenter's job easier. Daniel want to compare notes between his experience with online teaching and Joni's experience with in-person teaching
- [name= Batool] the helper will hopefully be able to collect information about who are struggling (especially with the set-up and installations of the packages because we will be using Docker image), Mateusz suggested a set-up session before the demo session for the docker image, Elnaz also suggested to add make it optional abo and Nora suggested to have both options packages/Docker available.

4. How long do you expect it will take to teach your trial run of a single episode?

- [name=Daniel] ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüò¨ 
- [name=Mike] This is actually the piece of data that I'm most interested to find out.
- [name= Elnaz] I am planning to make it within the one hour, which is the schedule but since it is a long and continuous lesson, I think I have to choose a part of the lesson which will use part of the lesson in which Bioconductor package is used. 
- [name= Joni] I've scheduled 1hr15mins. There are actually two sessions this one and a similar one focussing on computer vision.  There will be a break in between. 
- [name= Nora] I'm aiming for my episode to be around 20 minutes but haven't mapped my exercises out fully so that may be a little unrealistic! I have at least one discussion scheduled so that will have an impact. There's a difference between self-paced time expectations vs instructor led.  
- [name= Batool] I don't think it'll take more than 90 minutes.
- [name=Mark] I think I'm expecting 15 minutes for the episode but I haven't tested that yet. My worry is that in the trial run I'll just accelerate through it.

5. What are you looking forward to about the trial run, and what worries you?

- [name=Nora] I'm worried about getting questions for things I don't have the answer to, but I'm REALLY looking forward to getting the lesson as a whole in front of people and getting the right feedback to make the whole thing awesome. ALSO worried about managing expectations and hoping our audience realises that it's a work in progress and are ok with that!  
- [name=Mike] I'm most looking forward to getting feedback. I'm also looking forward to seeing how the different episodes build on each other, and wear there are gaps that need filling.
- [name= Joni] Looking forward to getting in front of students again and talking about these things i'm interested in.  Not looking forward to getting a lot of blank faces or a lot of bored faces, connecting with the students in terms of getting them to connect with the topic as relevant to them and their projects. 
- [name= Elnaz] A lot of things. Time management, which part to teach, the quality, connection, discussion, questions people  may ask, installation part, and a time plan for sending emails to all people and being ready for teaching.
- [name= Batool] I think I sometimes switch windows while teaching online (e.g. RStudio and the Terminal), but zoom doesn't allow for it. 
- [name=Daniel] I'm really looking forward to getting feedback and seeing if what we've planned translates well or not. There is a lot of interest in the topic we're working on, so I'm keen to get to a point where it can become more of a community-developed thing and this will be a good start. I am a bit concerned that people may challenge my expertise on the topic.  
- [name=Mark] An opportunity to test material on a new audience and to hear some of the use cases people may have. Worries: testing on a mystery audience.

6. Which aspect of writing your episode have you found most challenging?

- [name=Nora] Right now I'm struggling with finding my voice, I wonder if it's because I'm writing on behalf of the Carpentries, not sure. I'm usually alot more relaxed in tone as I know my audience so personally (staff at the Library). And I usually include lighthearted jokes, and lots of video clips to supplement the learning etc. I'm worried what I'm creating for this lesson is a bit boring and not so engaged without all that as a result!  
- [name= Elnaz] I think about details. No unclear thing should be observed in the lesson, I think. There should be instructions for all kind of users (OS) and have helpful thinks.
- [name=Mike] It's been hard with our group dynamic to make sure I am not repeating topics, and making sure to make all of the right connections across the whole lesson.
- [name=Joni] Time to focus
- [name= Batool] Th introduction, as we move to another episode, we go back to the intro and add more details. I think the intro has to be written in the end.
- [name=Daniel] I've found (am finding) it a bit of a shift to think of something that will be delivered live but is also more conceptual. Otherwise, there is a bit more back-and-forth between explaining and type x in the terminal. Trying to do that with a conceptual lesson is still a WIP for me. 
- [name=Mark] Deciding which content is relevant to the student, and which is relevant to my episode and which can be covered later. There is so much I could include!


7. homework (**Remember there is no call next week, and the next session was rescheduled to Thursday 8 April.**):
    - (ALL) If you have not already done so, complete a review of the episode you were assigned.
    - (ALL) Coordinate with the helper(s) you recruited for your Trial Run, to ensure they are prepared to support you in teaching and collecting feedback.
    - (ALL) In a scheduled "Trial Run," teach (at least) one episode of your lesson.
    - (ALL) Open issues on your lesson repository to record the required changes to your lesson that were identified during/after the trial run.
    - (ALL) Before the Study Group next meets, reflect on [the discussion prompts for the next session](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/study-groups/09-reflecting/).
