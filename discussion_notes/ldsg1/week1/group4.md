## Agenda

1. Welcome & Icebreaker
    - Please sign in by adding your details to the *Participants* section above.
    - (verbal) Group Facilitator introductions
        - who you are
        - where you are
        - previous experience with lesson development and The Carpentries lesson template
        - Facilitators:
            - Kate Hertweck: Instructor and early Maintainer coordinator. Involved in development of DC Genomics materials, continue to be involved in development of the lessons. Well-versed in the template and its history and also how to tweak things for a lesson. Looking forward to the program to enrich and invigorate lesson development work.
            - Yuka: PhD student in Vancouver BC. DC Genomics lesson maintainer. Have been teaching various versions of Carpentries lessons, tweaking and tailoring data and lessons for target audience. Looking forward to learning about all the lesson you are developing
    - (verbal) Participant introductions
        - who you are
        - where you are
        - about the lesson you will be developing during the program - what is it about? who is it for?
        - previous experience (if any) with lesson development and The Carpentries lesson template
        - Fan: software work for science, organizing open source projects, sustainability, engineering practices for software in data-intensive research, two ideas for lessons: 1) software citations for developers (identifiable and discoverable), 2) packaging code for distribution, sharing, specifically in R; no previous experience with lesson template (only looked at it)
        - Jon: U New Mexico, libraries, research data management, revitalize economy through smart electrical grid/sustainable energy tech, includes leveraging Carpentries (instructor training), use cases around engineering data; multiple possible lessons: analytic pipeline for engineers, digital badges, data management; no prior experience with lesson template (Toby notes another participant in another group is working on engineering lesson, with flight data)
        - James: Australia, CSIRO, research scientist, mathematical modeling, smart electrical grids/sustainable energy, open source projects, lesson on Julia for research data, workflow to using data for modeling, not much experience with template (working with someone else in Boston on lesson, but they're not joining calls)
        - Alex: lecturer at Ada College in London. no formal lesson yet, building on Docker and Kubernetes, cloud for genomics; digital humanities, new to Carpentries and is familiarizing self with organization tools
        - Rhonda: Durham, NC, digital community archivist, gaining familiarity with tools and resources, building skills to help teach others how to use these tools; also learning about Carpentries community
2. Housekeeping notes
    - **Introduction to CodiMD - https://codimd.carpentries.org/features**. You likely will not need all the features described, but quite useful to check in this resource when you have any questions.
    - After each group discussion, notes will be stored in [the study-groups repository](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/study-groups/tree/gh-pages/discussion_notes), publicly visible. Toby will archive by Thursday, February 18. Notes **do not need to be exhaustive**, but should note the main points discussed to give a good summary of the conversation - a record of links of useful resources that people found rather than an exact transcript of what each person said.
        - This is the first cohort to go through this study group process, so notes are important for helping us tweak and improve the process in the future.
        - Please be general of recording certain comments by participants for privacy reasons since these notes will be publicly available.
    - [Planned schedule for rotating roles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nk6sUI00XGPKL7eNms0VNfcSySpElUDtI3utejXBRC8/edit?usp=sharing)
        - A few days before each call, the assigned Discussion Lead should make a copy of [the shared notes template](https://codimd.carpentries.org/lesson-development-study-groups) and fill in the agenda. They should send a link to the Curriculum Community Developer (Toby), who will fill in the homework tasks, the "sticky notes" survey link, and any logistical points for discussion.
            - Currently, some participants are scheduled as facilitator for multiple weeks; it's likely we'll replace your second assigned week with one of the group leaders (Kate, Yuka, Toby)
            - Please let Toby know if you are unable to attend or facilitate assigned meetings.

3. Participant questions: What are you unsure about? What would you like more information on? How can we support you during the Study Groups program?
    - Are there expectations about what happens to lessons following study groups: community involvement in lesson development, Carpentries incubator/lab?
        - Incubator and Lab are relatively new within Carpentries, and responding to needs within community. Former (incubator) is a single place where community members can share community-contributed lessons that are currently in development. Latter (lab) is one of two places lessons can reside within Carpentries system after incubator. This happens when they are stable and fully developed, and available for other members to use confidently. The other option is for an incubator lesson to move to a lesson program (Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry); this is determined by the curriculum advisory committees for the relevant lesson program. There is also a lesson review process (associated with JOSE, Journal for Open Source Education). Following this study group, there will be a series of discussion calls (and tool-ups) related to lesson development, including accessibility and sharing of lesson materials. Also possible connections with mentoring program.
        - This group of participants will also be badged in AMY (the Carpentries participant database, including instructor training), indicating badged individuals have some level of competence/expertise/experience.


     - Is there anything out of scope as a Carpentries lesson?
         - Right now, not really! Carpentries has a mission of supporting data and computing skills for researchers and librarians, but lessons for the incubator haven't been explicitly limited. Eventually we may have expectations associated with types of lessons present in the Carpentries Lab.
         - Proprietary software may be something that doesn't really fit the Carpentries community and may be logistically difficult to implement as a Carpentry style lesson.


    - What does it take for a lesson to be "finished"?
        - There's a section of the curriculum development handbook that describes the lesson lifecycle that describes various stages of completion and robustness of lessons.


    - What does it look like to contribute to existing lessons?
        - There are labels included in issues for lesson repositories indicating when assistance is wanted for development. Learn more here: https://carpentries.org/help-wanted-issues/
        - This particular study group is focused on developing a new lesson, applying principles of reverse instructional design. It's a bit of a different process to build from an existing lesson, but still doable if you've found something about which you are very passionate.

5. What are some of the advantages of developing an open source lesson? What are some of the disadvantages?
    - (No time to cover question this week)
6. Which of the seven principles of learning, defined by Ambrose et al. and summarised in CDH Chapter 1, are particularly relevant to The Carpentries lesson design and development? Are there any that you think are less relevant?
    - (No time to cover question this week)
    - Students’ prior knowledge can help or hinder learning
    - How students organize knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know
    - Students’ motivation determines, directs, and sustains what they do to learn
    - To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned
    - Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students’ learning
    - Students’ current level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning
    - To become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning
7. Homework: (if you don't have time to do everything, make sure you prioritize reading!)
    - Work with the Curriculum Community Developer (Toby) to ensure your lesson repository is created in The Carpentries Incubator. Step 1, if you haven't done it already, is to open an issue in the Proposals repository: https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/proposals/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=issue_proposal.md
    - Read Chapter 3: _Deciding what to teach_ of the Curriculum Development Handbook.
    - Make a copy of the [Lesson Design Notes Template](https://codimd.carpentries.org/HPwUE3FnTeSQJ9-_5EfU7Q?edit) in your preferred format. You can use this page to record important decisions made about the design of your lesson during and after the Study Groups Program.
    - Add a link to your Lesson Design Notes next to where you signed in on this shared notes document.
    - Write at least one **learner profile** for your lesson and add it to your Lesson Design Notes, making sure your profile(s) answer the questions listed in the chapter.
8. **Weekly "Sticky Note" feedback**: please give us your feedback about this week by [filling out this two-question form][sticky-notes-link]
