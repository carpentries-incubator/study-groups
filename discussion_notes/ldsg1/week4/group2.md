## Agenda

### Welcome & Icebreaker 

1. What is your favourite movie or TV series?  Or something you watched recently and particularly enjoyed (or not at all!)

    - (Dan) Portlandia (TV series) - I need laughs during the pandemic
    - (Mateusz) at the beginning of the pandemic I watched all the Nordic crime shows, now watching Korean crime/political shows on netflix
    - (PS) The Parliament (TV series) - it's a cross-national comedy show with multiple languages ... and it is still funny despite the polyglott setting
    - (Tuomas) Doctor Who - It's a great description of Britain and British people
    - (Maria) Better call Saul - It goes through the life of Saul Goodman, a key character in breaking bad.
    - (Mosè) anything related to Star Wars
    - (Aleks) slow-watching 'Breaking Bad' with my husband
    - (Colin) The Expanse, Star Trek meets the West Wing

### _Defining Objectives_

1. What are described as _learning objectives_ in the reading material are sometimes referred to as _learning outcomes_ elsewhere in the literature. Do you prefer one of these terms to the other? Do you think either term is more appropriate to describe the skills a lesson/episode will teach? If so, why? 

    - (Dan) Although I don't have a strong preference, learning outcomes connotes more of a focus on the skills that learners will gain from the workshop; learning objectives has more of a connotation (to me) of what tasks we will accomplish during the course of the workshop.
    - (Mosè) I like the definitions in Teaching Tech Together: "objectives" for what the teacher plans to deliver, "outcome" from what the learners actually get
        - If teaching is successful, they should match
    - (Colin) Slightly inclined towards outcomes instead of objectives. Outcomes implies you will achieve it, objective implies you might.
    - (PS) For me, these concepts are something independent and each can be quantified. objectives is a topic that you want to convey, outcome is a concept that you DID convey. One is prospective, the other is retrospective. The learning outcomes can be quantified by formative assessment. The objectives can only be defined by those authoring the content.
        - 30-40% of objectives learned is a success
    - (Maria) I dont have a strong preference either, but I think learning objectives reflects better than the learner has to be active on the learning experience rather than learning as a by product outcome of the leason.

    
 2. What do you think are the main challenges in defining learning objectives for a lesson?

    - (Colin) getting the level of ambition right. Ensuring that it joins up with the learner profiles, concept maps and actual content. 
    - (Dan) It can be challenging to narrow down to just a few objectives, but this process is helpful in better focusing the lesson and focusing each episode
    - (PS) my main challenge is to keep to them, i.e. I observed myself settling for some number of objectives and then changing my mind during the course of creating content, going back to the objectives, changing them, changing the content again, ...
        - Community help is valuable to get out of this loop
    - (Maria) adjusting to the learners expectations
        - How do you infer the learners expectations
            - Pre-workshop survey can be helpful
        - (PS) maybe want to share a technique I picked up somewhere: if I have the feeling that conveying the expectations didn't go too well or I am simply in need of a productive ice breaker, I stand in front of a whiteboard and ask people to let me know their first ideas about the workshop they are starting to attend right now; while they tell me the keywords/phrases I sort them silently (a fitting concept goes to the left; a non fitting concept goes to the right of the whiteboard); once done, I put titles above each column: "this is something we are going to talk about", "this is something for outside of this workshop"
    - (Mosè) Adapting the objectives to the level of the learners
    - (Tuomas) Refining from vague concepts to concrete things the learners can take away

3. Did the process of defining target audience and learning objectives change what you plan to teach in your lesson? If so, how?

    - (Mosè) It helps to restructure what to teach and make it more "concrete"
    - (Colin) change might be too strong a word, but it certainly refined it. Had already spent a lot of time going over it in my mind.
    - (Maria) I think defining the target audience comes before designing the lesson, so yes the lesson may be adapted acording to the target audience
    - (Dan) Somewhat, it helped to explicitly connect the learning objectives to meeting (what we assume about) the expectations/goals of the learners - and of the different types of learners. 
    - (PS) most certainly, but I am always wondering if the pre-workshop survey wasn't aligned with the prospective content or if the learners are really that different to what we expect
    - (Tuomas) How much do the target audience and the real audience match? What do you do when they don't?
        - Market the workshop to the target audience
        - Select material to fit the audience
        - Listen to feedback
        - Sometimes you can use a dataset from the domain of the students, or explain how the dataset is similar to data learners are more familiar with

4. Do you think concept maps can be a helpful tool when planning the structure of your lesson?  Do you know or use other tools?

    - (Colin) I don't find them very helpful. Generally graphing things like this doesn't help me much and if anything can confuse me. Just making lists or writing outlines works better for me.
    - (Dan) Usually. Concept maps can help the instructors atomize, clarify and organize the concepts to be taught, in their own minds. The more clearly instructors conceptualize the material, the more clearly they will be able to teach it to new learners.  However, for some concepts, a concept map can feel excessive.
    - (Mosè) I have a bad relation with conceptual maps.  I struggle to read them, and often find there is too much information.
    - (Maria) Absolutely. I think they help you keeping within the 7+2 rule for information overload and organisig your ideas around.
    - (PS) I am using them from time to time, but I haven't had the heureka moment yet; the 7+2 rule is challenging for me as I tend to use very general concepts like "1. teach cooking", "2. teach preparing ingredients" so the objectives tend to be over-general :-/ I am still learning to teach.

5. What verbs did you use to describe the learning objectives?

    - (Colin) I found myself trying to use words from Blooms Taxonomy, not sure if we were supposed to as I can see many examples in mature lessons that don't. But especially using "understand" and "analyse" or "compare", sometimes "create" or "implement". Worried I've not balanced it correctly to match the pyramid.
        - does anybody else find themselves doing this backwards sometimes, writing course content and then summarising with learning objectives?  Someone does
    - (Mosè) A small subset of Bloom's taxonomy: understand, solve, formulate
    - (PS) I am currently in a mood to stick to Bloom's taxonomy strictly, but when deadlines are approaching, such tools go overboard quickly - so frankly I am still waiting for the paypack moment where Bloom's taxonomy shines; in general, a friend of mine (who is a high school teacher) once made a good suggestion to: define learning objectives from coarse to fine grain (that was so far always a help)
    - (Dan) I found myself repeating a lot of the same verbs - understand, compute, select, determine, identify
    - (Maria) Understand, use, create ... Going to the Blooms taxonomy pyramid is useful to me, because it helps visualizing the hierarchy, which is not natural to me at all yet. 
    - (Tuomas) I think verbs that are as concrete as possible -- select, solve, find
    - (Toby) Focus on skills that learners can use for exercises

6. In what other ways, if any, do you plan to make use of concept maps in the development and/or content of your lesson?

## Homework

- (ALL=a task to be done by all collaborators on a lesson; ONE=a task to be done by only one collaborator per lesson):
    - (ONE, but discuss with your collaborators first) Create placeholder files for the other episodes in your lesson. Optionally, add learning objectives to these episode files too.
    - (ALL, see link for more info) Schedule an opportunity to teach at least one episode of your new lesson. This trial run should take place between sessions 7 and 8 (26 March 2021 - 9 April 2021). See [the Episode Trial Run callout on the "lesson" page](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/study-groups/04-objectives/#episode-trial-run) for more details.
        - When you have scheduled your trial run, add details to this CodiMD: https://codimd.carpentries.org/ldsg1-trial-runs
        - The act of teaching for the first time is not the end of development, but a point somewhere in the middle
        - Feedback from learners can cause major changes in the lesson
        - May be sensible to choose an episode early in the lesson to worry less about depedencies
        - Get in touch with Toby if the dates are not good
        - Audience can be
            - Private: colleagues etc.
            - Members of the study group
            - Public invitation
        - Get feedback form from Toby
        - Each collaborator teaches one episode
    - (ALL) Read [Chapter 4: Designing Challenges of the Curriculum Development Handbook](https://cdh.carpentries.org/designing-challenges.html).
    - (ONE, but discuss with your collaborators first) If your lesson will use an example dataset, in the Data Set section of your Lesson Design Notes briefly describe the features and requirements an ideal dataset would have.
    - (ALL) Identify at least one appropriate example data set/narrative for your lesson, and add a link to the data set in the shared notes document.
    - (ALL) In the Data Set section of your Lesson Design Notes, briefly summarise:
        - why you chose these datasets/examples,
        - what advantages they have as a tool for learning,
        - and what disadvantages/difficulties/complexities they would introduce.
