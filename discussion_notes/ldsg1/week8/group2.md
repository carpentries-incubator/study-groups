## Agenda

### Welcome & Icebreaker:

1. What are you looking forward to most about life returning to "normal" post-pandemic?
    - Dan: Teaching in person, not on Zoom, although I'm sure we'll be doing much of that still.   Working in caf√©s!  Traveling.
    - Mateusz: teaching and in person meetings, some coffee machine chats, being able to travel a bit longer distance
    - Sue: I look forward to hugging my 90-year-old mother. I also look forward to going back to work and seeing the people whom I used to pass in the hallways and say hello. There are a few people who always make everyone feel good every time you run into them.
    - Maria: I look forward to going to a cafe/restaurant with friends. And traveling

### Discussion

NOTE: Nobody in attendance today had a trial run scheduled prior to this session.

2. What are we hoping to gain from the trial runs?
    - Sue: I hope to get valuable feedback for improving the training next time we offer it.
        - People are very perceptive when giving feedback. Amazing that people can tell you exactly what they    think you have done good and how you can improve
        - How well will biologists take to mathematical equations? Hopefully is not an obsticle
        - Mateusz - why Carpentries is not providing MOOCs
    - Maria: I hope to get feedback on the level of background I am providing.
        - Bioconductor - for proteomics people.  Hoping to give enough background on object/data structure in R.  Spending 30-45 min on background.
    - Dan: I'm interested to how the model of transforming a textbook to a Carpentries lesson works out in the live session
        - Carpentries lessons are available online (like a textbook) yet we provide workshops because it's a different mode of learning, more interactive, more support
    - 
    - 

3. What are our concerns going into the trial runs?
    - Sue: I'm always concerned about a broad spread in participant skill levels. Everyone knows that they must know R in order to take this training, and they have answered questions that indicate their level of proficiency. Nevertheless, there are always bored people and lost people, but mostly people who find the training just at the right level.
        - Harder for people to help each other online.  People go into breakout rooms and get lost when they come back.
    - 
    - Maria: I may not have much time to develop the lesson to the level I was hoping to. I would be concern if the learners find that the topic is not useful for them. 
        - If they don't understand the object, they might feel it's too difficult to use.  Will show them the cake first. 
    - 
    - Dan: Concerned about the ability of learners to absorb concepts that may be more math-y concepts than coding concepts.  And time necessary to refine the lesson before the workshop.
        - Assuming some background that may not be there.
    - 
    - 

4. How do you plan to gather feedback from participants?
    - Sue & Dan: Google Forms surveys at the end of each session - like stickies.  SurveyMonkey at the end
    - Maria: Content vs. Delivery feedback via Google forms
    - 

5. How long are trial runs planned for?
    - Sue: 3 hours for trial run (followed by 3 more x 3 hour sessions)
    - Maria:  trial run - 1 (1 hour) of 5 lessons

### Homework and General Q&A

- homework (ALL: a task to be done by all collaborators on a lesson; ONE: a task to be done by only one participant per lesson, ideally after discussion with their collaborators)
    - (ALL) Create more issues on your lesson repository, as a way to keep track of outstanding tasks and improvements that could be made.
    - (ALL) Read [Section A.3 (Using GitHub Issue Labels) of CDH Appendix A: The Carpentries Incubator](https://cdh.carpentries.org/the-carpentries-incubator.html#using-github-issue-labels).
    - (ONE) Add help-wanted and good-first-issue labels to the issues on your repository as appropriate.
    - (Optionally, ONE) ask Toby to include your lesson in the listing on the [Help Wanted page](https://carpentries.org/help-wanted-issues/) of The Carpentries website.
    - (ALL) Read [Chapter 6: Community Development Roles](https://cdh.carpentries.org/community-development-roles.html) and [Chapter 7: Lesson Life Cycle of the Curriculum Development Handbook](https://cdh.carpentries.org/the-lesson-life-cycle.html).
    - (ALL) Open at least one Pull Request to fix an issue on another lesson repository in [The Carpentries Incubator](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/).
