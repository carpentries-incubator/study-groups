## Agenda

1. Welcome & Icebreaker 
    - (Need an idea for an icebreaker question? Check out [the list of icebreakers from the Instructor Training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/icebreakers/index.html).)
    - What is your fav sandwich & sauces that come with?
    - https://www.paseo.com/best-sandwich-in-seattle
    - Fav Po-Boy place (Shrimp & Oyster fried) http://domilisespoboys.com/
    - tuna sandwich with ranch and peppercorn
    - cheesesteak for vegetarian, saucewise
2. How successful was your trial run? Consider this both from the perspective of the learners - how successfully do you think they learned the skills you were aiming to teach? - and your own - how helpful was the trial run as an exercise in gathering feedback about the ongoing development of your lesson?
    - Fan: took time to set folks up, needed personalized attention for each person
        - how to make this easier in future? use an episode to get set up? started from participants cloning github repo, but maybe that's not a great approach. Maybe better included in a larger collection of modules, or require more pre-requisites. Perhaps frame the exercise more specifically at the start, to lower the level of difficulty (fill-in-blanks)
        - What type of setup do you need for contextualizing the materials first? Difference between citing someone else's software vs setting your own software up to be citable makes a difference! Given a repository with some code already in it, do you want to publish the code, or learn how other people have published code? Starting in the middle of the process can be difficult to teach
        - A trial run has given lots more items for the to-do list! This makes it a successful trial run:)
        - How to fit this into the Carpentries setting? Additional slides, or use original content 
        - If live-coding heavy, not much additional material is necessary. However, its difficult to teach material that Fan is developing. Perhaps having additional slides to introduce your lesson will be helpful for participants. 
    - Jon: worked with undergrad helpers + participants
        - most people in class were familiar with Carpentries style already, but novice in terms of technical content (pandas). Maybe not optimal audience for intended lessons, so they ended up learning something different than expected
        - from instructor standpoint, it was good: got feedback about how lesson is designed (starting point of lesson, covering basic syntax using python), they suggested using standard intro to python syntax (instead of data frames) for teaching intro python
        - need to anticipate common errors: include screen shots and examples of errors within lesson. This is hard, but also probably necessary. Can include additional resources for troubleshooting (e.g., drop down/linked issue, but not include in main lesson content). Could also live-demo common issues.
        - participants say Jupyter notebooks are horrible. If you're not familiar with the web browser interface, this can be difficult. Makes code inaccessible afterwards (unless you're using continuing to use Jupyter notebooks). There is no perfect interface for novices. Everything has either user abstraction necessary, or makes this too separated from actual code
4. What worked well about the material you have developed?
    - reverse instructional design!
6. What needs changing before next time? Consider what needs changing about both the lesson and your approach to teaching it.
7. How well did you estimate how long the episode(s) would take to teach?
8. What do you need help with to improve your lesson?
    - how do we find people to help develop?
    - thinking about framing issues that can be used for asking for assistance
10. Now that you have followed the process of backwards design from first steps to teaching the new lesson for the first time
    1. what are some benefits of the backwards design approach to lesson development?
    2. what are some of the disadvantages?
    What do you wish you had known - or that you had been told - when you began developing this lesson?
8. **Homework:** (ALL: a task to be done by all collaborators on a lesson; ONE: a task to be done by only one participant per lesson, ideally after discussion with their collaborators)
    - (ALL) Create more issues on your lesson repository, as a way to keep track of outstanding tasks and improvements that could be made.
    - (ALL) Read Section A.3 (Using GitHub Issue Labels) of CDH Appendix A: The Carpentries Incubator.
    - (ONE) Add help-wanted and good-first-issue labels to the issues on your repository as appropriate.
    - (Optionally, ONE) ask Toby to include your lesson in the listing on the Help Wanted page of The Carpentries website.
    - (ALL) Read Chapter 6: Community Development Roles and Chapter 7: Lesson Life Cycle of the Curriculum Development Handbook.
    - (ALL) Open at least one Pull Request to fix an issue on another lesson repository in The Carpentries Incubator.

::: info
**A heads-up about next week**: next week is the final week of this round of the program! The call will be a little different from the usual group discussion. Toby will present some tips on how to manage your lesson repository and how to collaborate effectively via GitHub. 
He will also talk about possible next steps for you and your lesson beyond the end of this round. There will be some time for general discussion and Q&A.
**Also next week!** The end-of-program feedback survey. Please please fill this out when you receive it!
