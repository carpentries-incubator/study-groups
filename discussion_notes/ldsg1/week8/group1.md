## Agenda

1. Welcome & Icebreaker 
- Favourite Mythological Creatures
    - Elnaz story regarding the Iranian Phoenix which could encourage people by firing them up with its feathers.
    - MK legend of the dragon of Krakow.  A dragon lives next to a castle and occasionally wanders off to eat people and damage buildings.  Shoemaker infused sheep with sulpher and the dragon eat it and then drank water from the Wisla river and exploded.
    - Batool methodlogical creature is Jinn (Arabic: جن‎, jinn) —are supernatural creatures in early pre-Islamic Arabian and later Islamic mythology and theology
    - JP The legend of the two highlanders. 
    - Daniel Victorian fairies at the bottom of the garden.  
    - Mark Story of the Lampton worm.  John Lampton found a worm and threw it in a well where it grew enormous and terrorised the countryside.  John then returend and slew the worm.
    - Mike's vacation story; The local lake had a resident monster(mascot).  lake Willougby with a monster named Willy.
    - Nora Dadealus story.  Also the father of Icarus?
    - 

2. How successful was your trial run? Did you run into any problems?
    - Daniel: It was useful but it's a bit hard to say how well it went. I think the material we have all preperaed is looking good but it was a bit hard to know if the delivery went down well because of the format in which we delivered it. I also realized how time it will take 
        - Hard to establish how people are responding.
        - Two hours and full of content except for a quick break
        - very useful expoerience to see how it worked in practice
    - Nora: It was alright, I've gotten a better sense of how long it will take in reality including exercises which is great, and will change a little bit of the text as a result as well.
        - It was alright.  Same seeion as Daniel.
        - Shorter time than would normally have been expected
        - unsure if correct audience
        - better sense of how long it will take
        - really good activities
        - some ideas on how to change the text
    - Mike: I thought our trial run was very successful. It was great just to be able to deliver the material to an audience, to break out of the "bubble" of developing material for the audience of just yourself.
        - Helpful to deliver the material
        - couldn't really guage reactions
        - completely different experience to delvier it as opposed to writing
        - helps break out of the lesson writing bubble and spot connections between material
    - Mark: We got through the material and the audience seemed to think it covered the topic fairly well. However, it's difficult to gauge reactions in an online format. It was useful to do it and see my episode in the context of the others.
        - Found it a different context
        - Episode meant to be part of a lead in
        - Exposed different ways it could have been delivered.
    - JP: So good I was asked to repeat it.  Some aspects I felt did not work out.  Few students had configured anaconda as requested.  What was intended to be a 3hr interactive tutorial turned into more of a 3hr live coding lecture.  This led to the material being completed a bit too quickly and me needing to add some stuff on the fly but it worked out ok.  It was a modified session aimed at Motorsports students working with data from ros bags.  
        - In person delivery more difficult without being able to go to peoples desks
        - Audience perspective found to require more tailoring of lesson.
    - Batool: It went very well. The feedback was great (not sure they were objectives) and it made us realise what worked and what should be improved. [This is the link to the workshop](https://batoolmm.github.io/scRNA-seq-demo-workshop/)
        - Went better than expected
        - hard to evaluate because it was delivered online
        - no objectors
        - most of the delegates were known quantities
        - useful to say the lecture out load
        - 
    - Elnaz:
        - Found delviering opened up conenctions.
        - Found it a good experience

3. What worked well about the material you have developed?
    -  Nora: I think our exercises are really engaging and useful.
    - Mike: I think we did a good job in terms of hitting the correct level of abstraction -- describing what machine learning does, as well as concerns, without getting too into the weeds.
        - We decided to allocate 25 minutes each plus breaks
        - Sometimes stopped short but gave hints as to where things can be streamlined
    - JP: I found my conceptual design section worked well across both groups.  Conceptual design isn't often discussed in the context of CAE(Computer Aided Engineering) or solution space search and apparently that was something that the students had not yet encountered.  The uses of classes and the ability of python to be able to pass functions to functions was useful here.
    - Daniel: I think the content flows well between lessons  I overall. The exercises were also nice and I think that the content would work well to deliver in an in person session. The material is quite 'text heavy' but I think that could also be nice for people following the material outside of the lesson
        - Lesson was text heavy
        - Focussed on writing a lot of material before session
        - Works well as something you read but needed translation to make it work as a workshop
        - The amount of material was an issue.
    - Mark: The material fits well together and we each raise some similar points but coming from different perspectives of machine learning. We cover a really good range of topics across the whole lesson.
    - Batool: The images were good to use in the introduction (there are a lots of concepts and it would have been harder to explain verbally) and the coding part by Elnaz was also well-explained.
    - Elnaz
        - Problems anticipated for managing the time
        - Has anyone found good ways to predict time required?
        - Does anyone have ideas for improvement?

4. What needs changing before next time?
    - Nora: I still need to finalise the text of my draft episode to reflect what I ended up presenting and any feedback I got but it thankfully won't be much. Still work to be done to make sure all the episodes flow well together and that concepts are introduced in the right places, I think we're mostly there but needs a proper review which we've planned. We need to put our new timing's in as well. One thing we're going to add is a glossary which was a recommendation we received in the feedback (http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/reference.html#glossary)
        - More time to test activities required
        - the content is about 20minutes but two activities 15 minutes each should be included.
    - Daniel: I want to get the material a little bit more polished still  and think we also need to do a little bit of work ot make sure that everything flows between the episodes. We also decided to add an extra episode to  cover some material that didn't quite fit in other parts of the workshop. 
    - Mike: I want to work adding additional figures, as well as improving the ones that are there. I didn't realize how much I would rely on them when delivering the material as slides.
    - Mark: I'd like to think a bit more about how to explain a couple of concepts and also whether I am meeting the stated objectives. There's also some work to do around consistency of terminology between episodes.
    - Batool: I think we should introduce lesson vocabs and terms for the students to make it as a reference and add more images and gifs in the lesson. 
    - JP: better pre-prep and opportunities for trouble shooting where students struggle to install dependencies
        - Possible use of binder service to reduce install struggles but could reduce the ability of students to go away afterwards with a working install
    - Elnaz
        - Addition of lines can add uncertainty regarding the additional time required.  Needs practise
        - Timing lessons a critical skill

5. What do you need help with to improve your lesson?
    - Nora: Advice on how to deliver this content live in terms of presentation. Oh, see Mike's comment below...heh. :) I'd also like to deliver my episode to some folks in my library to see if I've gotten the tone just right.
        - being able to compare and contrast how others and tailored and delviered the same lesson would be very useful
    - Mike: Most of us ended up creating slides to deliver our material, and it would be nice to have an integrated Carpentries template that generated those automatically, so that we don't have 2 separate sources to maintain. Or even a way to keep slide materials next to lessons. 
    - Mark: I'd like to run through it with someone and get direct feedback as the lesson goes to see what makes sense and what needs further explanation. It would be also useful to get advice on timings for exercises.
        - being able to talk around points is very useful
        - Not wanting to overload the slides themselves
    - Daniel: I did some 'illustrations' which are of dubious quality. I quite like using illustrations though so am hoping someone with some talent for producing these can help make them look a bit less bad. I also would like to get feedback from some specific people about the lesson content before it is shared more widely. 
    - JP: Time to focus on iterating the lessons and good feedback.  Peers with doomain knowledge don't neccessarily kow programming and programmers don't necessarily have domain knowledge so this is a critical weakness however.
    - Batool: I think it will be useful to open an issue with a simple roadmap and milestones for the lesson in the repository.
    - Mateuz
        - Found we often end up presenting slides when not doing interactive sessions.  
        - Some lessons would be advantaged by having more visuals.

6. What are some advantages and disadvantages of the backwards design approach to lesson development?  
    - Nora: I can't imagine making a lesson without doing the backwards design approach. It's essential and I recommend it to anyone thinking about developing training.
    - Mark: It helps to have the objectives upfront and then there's a ready made sense check once the lesson is developed. Otherwise I'd be retrofitting the objectives and might miss the wood for the trees. There would also be a temptation to just jump straight in without planning.
    - Mike: Helpful in terms of figuring out what is in and out of "scope". I can't really think of any disadvantages.
    - JP: Considering the ILO's normal but not necessarily well discussed in course design generally.  Particularly for craft/experience based topics like programming is addressed here.
    - I think it does help avoid going on auto pilot with what you end up covering because you are forced to think about it a lot more upfront. I think the potential issue with it (depending on the type of lesson) is that you might leave less time for actually reviewing materials. For a more conceptual or text heavy lesson re-writting material might be needed multiple times. 
    - Batool: It is extremely useful and I'd definitly recommand it to everyone. It force you to think about the desired results and how you can make an optimal design for the instructional  and the lesson.
    
7. What do you wish you had known - or that you had been told - when you began developing this lesson?
    - Nora: Just how much time it would take! 
    - Mike: I wish we had spent a bit more time working on concept maps. Making sure that different parts of the each individual lesson connected to other lessons would have benefited from this.
    - Daniel: I think focusing on the exercises as a way of structuring the lessons. I think this was me missing the importance of this part a little bit. 
    - Mark: I wish I'd thought about presenting it earlier.
    - JP: I wish I had anticipated how much less interaction than normal we would have with social distancing.  Also how much students would struggle with installing Anaconda and downloading the data and environment.yml

    - Batool: I wished I did a demo session earlier and I will definitely do another one again soon.
