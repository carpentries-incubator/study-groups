## Agenda

1. Welcome & Icebreaker 
    - what is a collaborative project that you really enjoyed working on? can you identify what made it so enjoyable?

* 
* Fan: A research project where we created a dataset for software citation. It is enjoyable because (1) everyone has their special expertise that they bring to the project. So we can work complementarily. (2) It's literally a remote collaboration project. It went well because everyone is responsive while good at communication, which making the team progress clear. But have to say that everyone in the project is good at virtual collaboration technologies.
* 
* Toby: the Jekyll Pages lesson project has been a lot of fun to work on and very satisfying. I think this is really to do with the team we have developing it: we all knew each other quite well beforehand, had a shautision for what the lesson will/should look like, and established a working patttern that worked for everyone right at the beginning.
* Kate: I'm in the middle of a very non-traditional collaborative project right now: a large tattoo covering my back and shoulder. I brainstormed the idea with my brother, found a tattoo artist whose style I liked, met with them initially to share the inspiration (a poem) and some ideas for the art. Then we met twice more to talk about the design as she drew it. Now we're halfway through the tattooing, with 2-3 more sessions to go, and it's been a really lovely experience working together on the overall design, placement, coloring, etc.
* Tim: Recently we build a new unit in the library and went thru a design process, but it required a lot of collboration and team building. It's always fun to build a new thing and it involved getting feedback from users and formulating the unit. 
* 
* Yuka: I was putting together a 2 day workshop with a college who was the best person I've ever had to collaborate with in both putting together the lessons and teaching. I think what made it such an enjoyable process was the mutual enthusiasm for the content we were teaching and how well we riffed off/complemented each other while we were teaching. 
* Jon: I participated in a group concert at a music school a few years ago where players of different ages and experience all got together and basically had a couple hours to learn to play a single piece, together. It worked because it was time bound, and there was a clear objective, and we got one chance to pull it off. And it was fun! So even though there was stress, egos, etc., all of the interpersonal stuff was overcome by the immediate, one-off objective. And it was supportive - nobody was performing alone.

2. Tips & tricks for collaborating on GitHub
    - [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/jekyll-pages-novice/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md)
        - [Mozilla Open Leaders' guide for how to write a good contributing guide](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-contributor-guidelines/)
        - [an example of a more in-depth contributor's/developer's guide](https://metawards.org/development.html) (hat-tip Natalie Thurlby for the recommendation)
    - keywords to trigger automatic actions
    - reviews
        - requesting a review
        - reviewing a Pull Request
        - suggestions
        - merge policies and branch protection
    - managing notifications
        - repository-level
        - account-level
        - filtering notification emails
    - [tagging a maintainer team](https://github.blog/2012-05-09-introducing-team-mentions/)
        - your lesson should have a Team associated with it, containing you, Toby, and any other people you have been collaborating with on the project. You can mention (@carpentries-incubator/team-name) this Team any time you want to attract the attention of all lesson maintainers at once.
    - [pinned issues](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/docker-introduction/issues)
        - keep an issue pinned to the top of the issue listing, so that it is easily noticeable for visitors.
        - useful if there is an important discussion that you want people to contribute to, or a problem that you really need help with
        - see link above for an example
    - issue labels and issue templates
        - label your issues to help others understand the type and progress/status of an issue.
        - remember that issues labelled `help-wanted` can be automatically listed on [the Help Wanted page](https://carpentries.org/help-wanted-issues/) if you opt in (contact Toby)
    - projects
        - the Projects tab of your GitHub repository provides an interface for organising and managing issues. If you are familiar with "Agile" project management, you can use this as a "kanban" board to organise tasks. It can also be used over a longer period to keep track of which issues are a priority and which can be left for later e.g. we have used a Project board to identify all the issues that need to be addressed before a lesson can be taught.
        - documentation here: https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards
    - [discussion boards](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions)
        - discussion forum for your github project. 
        - see an example: https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/docker-introduction/discussions
        - if you cannot activate this for your lesson repsoitory, contact me to give you the appropriate permissions.
    - topic tags
        - keep the topics on your lesson repository up-to-date! this will ensure your lesson is listed appropriately on The Carpentries website.
        - go to your repository homepage, click the gear symbol next to "About" and add/edit topics there.
        - Reminder: more about which topics to include here: https://cdh.carpentries.org/the-carpentries-incubator.html#topic-tags

    - [Glosario](https://glosario.carpentries.org/)
        - whenever you introduce a new term from your lesson topic, add a link to the definition
        - you can also write your own glossary in the `reference.md` file of your lesson repository
