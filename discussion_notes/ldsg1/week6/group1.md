## Agenda

1. Welcome & Icebreaker 
    - (Need an idea for an icebreaker question? Check out [the list of icebreakers from the Instructor Training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/icebreakers/index.html).)
- Are wrist watches relevant?
    - Seemed like an even split on either side of the debate

2. Are code chunks important for developing content?
- Mike - I think they are useful for "mapping out" an episode progressing -- especially in a way that can be tested ahead of the workshop to make sure outputs are consistent.
- Mark - For coding lessons they seem essential, you can see directly what a command does. Our lesson is very conceptual so it is more difficult to include code since we may end up overloading the students who don't know about programming. They are limited in how much you can demonstrate in a short piece of code.
- Batool - I think using live coding (code chunks) is very effective. It makes it easier for the instructor to walk learners through the steps
- Daniel - Our lesson is a bit weird and doesn't have code. We might include 'code like' chunks which help enforce how the concepts work in practice. 
- Nora - I think for my episode I won't have opportunity to use code chunks (introducing bias in AI as a concept rather than coding) however in other carpentry courses where I've encountered them they have been incredibly useful! 

3. Any thoughts on Cognitive Load and Challenge Exercises.
- Mark - There are really key concepts which need to be properly understood before reaching later episodes, so focus should be on those. Exercises maintain engagement.
- Nora - I really like the idea of having many small short challenges throughout a lesson. Keeps it lively and active while reinforcing.
- Mike - I think I remember from Instructor Training that they suggest introducing challenge exercises often, in order to "off-load" cognitive load.
- Daniel - Cognitive load might work a bit differently for our lesson since there are less 'hard dependencies' between different concepts 
- Batool - I love using "faded examples" which was introduced in Greg's book and some of the workshops I attended. It's less intimidating to ask the learners to fill in the gap of the code rather than solve all the problem. 

Aleksandra also brought up the point that exercises should be used as a tool to transfer from "working memory" after 7 +/- 2 concepts.

4. Importance of Learning objectives and Bloom's Taxonomy

**Recap of Bloom's taxonomy:**
- Remembering: Exhibit memory of previously learned material by recalling facts, terms, basic concepts, and answers. (recognize, list, describe, name, find)
- Understanding: Demonstrate understanding of facts and ideas by organizing, comparing, translating, interpreting, giving descriptions, and stating main ideas. (interpret, summarize, paraphrase, classify, explain)
- Applying: Solve new problems by applying acquired knowledge, facts, techniques and rules in a different way. (build, identify, use, plan, select)
- Analyzing: Examine and break information into parts by identifying motives or causes; make inferences and find evidence to support generalizations. (compare, contrast, simplify)
- Evaluating: Present and defend opinions by making judgments about information, validity of ideas, or quality of work based on a set of criteria. (check, choose, critique, prove, rate)
- Creating: Compile information together in a different way by combining elements in a new pattern or proposing alternative solutions. (design, construct, improve, adapt, maximize, solve)
-  Batool - learning objectives is not only important for the learner but also for the instructor. It help us to re-define our audiance.

Nora talked about how the Bloom's Taxonomy pyramid was useful for targetting which levels are relavent. 

Daniel - our lesson has to do with transmitting knowledge, and goal is to show how ML will be more relvant to their current work
    Nora - more important to show how to evaluate different approaches

5. How would you gauge learner's learning abilities?
- Mike - not sure if we've discussed this yet, but pre-workshop surveys could be helpful
- Nora - quizzes around terminology, and being able to identify bias in example datasets. Discussion will be more useful for identify misconceptions.
- Batool - Mind maps useful for making connections -- as an exercise for learners too.
6. Any thought's on expert awareness gap
- Mark - Gap in terms of assumption of prior education -- regional-based. Example of probability knowledge.
- Mike - going too slow risks making a few people bored but going too fast risks leavings omeone behind and dicouraging them from ever trying this again

- Toby brought up the idea that if you tell learners that you intend to cover a set of concepts, they will be disappointed if you don't get to it. Suggestion is to err on the side of assuming you have too many lesson material to cover in the allotted time. Expert awareness gap doesn't materialize until you try teaching.

Shrirang - Does Carpentries build in "back-up time" in lesson scheduling? Toby: More important to make sure that all learners are understanding material than to exhaustively cover all material.
Aleks: Nothing like piloting a live lesson to figure out timing, and correct assumptions.
Nora - post-it notes really useful for guaging whether learners are following along. Jargon is a very common source of learners missing out on a topic.
Batool - reiterated that Jargon busting is very important. Toby linked to [https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-overview/03-jargon-busting/index.html](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-overview/03-jargon-busting/index.html) in Zoom chat. Aleks linked to [https://github.com/anenadic/GitHub-Workshop#interface-tour-and-jargon-busting](https://github.com/anenadic/GitHub-Workshop#interface-tour-and-jargon-busting).

Shrirang: Any strategies for avoiding plagiarism when writing material about something you have read various resources about?
- Batool: check the license; email the author to ask for permission for re-use/citing.
- Daniel: nice to cite resources that provided inspiration/guidance while designing lesson - helpful for others to see links to these resources and for me to refer back to in the future
- Aleks - Keep a file that tracks images used, and where they came from in order to be able to properly credit. Also extends to "ideas borrowed from" or "inspired by".


- homework:
    - (ALL) Complete (at least) the episode you plan to teach in your trial run, and request review when it is ready.
        - You should request a review by opening a new issue on your lesson repository and tagging the assigned reviewer (@reviewer_username), telling them where to find the material that you would like them to review.
        - Find the name & GitHub username for the person assigned to review your episode in this sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nk6sUI00XGPKL7eNms0VNfcSySpElUDtI3utejXBRC8/edit?usp=sharing
    - (ALL, if you have time this week) Complete a review of the episode you were assigned. See the callout below for more details about how you should approach the review.
    - (ALL) In preparation for your Trial Run of an episode, read the two Carpentries Instructor Training bonus modules on online training:
