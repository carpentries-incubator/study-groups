>   the "connective tissue" text between them?
> - What are some common mistakes and misconceptions you encounter from learners
>   of the topic covered by your lesson?
>   - How will you diagnose and address these in your lesson?
> - How do you plan to account for your expertise while you write your lesson?

> ## Homework Tasks
>
> _Note for groups of participants collaborating on a single lesson:_
> _**ALL**: a task to be done by all collaborators on a lesson;_
> _**ONE**: a task to be done by only one participant per lesson,_
> _ideally after discussion with their collaborators._
>
> - (ALL) Complete (at least) the episode you plan to teach in your trial run,
>   and request review when it is ready.

> ## Episode Review
>
> One of your homework tasks is to review an episode being developed
> by another Study Group participant.
> When completing this review,
> your goal is to provide constructive feedback to the author(s) about
> the design, structure, and content of the episode.
> You should consider everything you have learned
> about lesson development up to this point:
>
> - Are the objectives of the lesson specific and focused on the skills being taught?
> - Do the exercises assess the skills described in the learning objectives?
>   Have they been designed with diagnostic power i.e. could an incorrect answer
>   provide the instructor with information about the learner's misconceptions?
> - Do the examples and tasks used in the episode feel authentic?
>   Do you think learners will be motivated to gain the skills being taught?
> - Is the length of the episode appropriate?
> - Do you think the episode is designed to manage cognitive load effectively?
>
> We estimate it will take ~30-60 minutes to review the episode.
>
> Submit your review as an issue or multiple issues on the lesson repository,
> and add a link or links to the review to the Study Group's shared
> notetaking document when you are done.
