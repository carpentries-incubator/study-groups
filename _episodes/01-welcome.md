{: .checklist }

This first discussion session will include a full round of introductions,
giving all participants an opportunity to tell the others attending:

- who they are.
- what their lesson will teach.
- their previous experience working with The Carpentries lesson template.

> ## Discussion Prompts
>
> - What are some of the advantages of developing an open source lesson?
> - What are some of the disadvantages?
> - Which of the seven principles of learning,
>   defined by Ambrose et al. and summarised in CDH Chapter 1,
>   are particularly relevant to The Carpentries lesson design and development?
> - Are there any that you think are less relevant?
> - CDH Chapter 1 also summarises the key steps in designing a lesson:
>   identifying the practical skills you want to teach;
>   designing challenges to assess understanding;
>   creating a narrative and choosing an appropriate dataset for your lesson;
>   and planning lesson content.
>   Which of these steps do you expect to be the most difficult in
>   the development of your lesson?

> ## Homework Tasks
>
> _Note for groups of participants collaborating on a single lesson:_
> _**ALL**: a task to be done by all collaborators on a lesson;_
> _**ONE**: a task to be done by only one participant per lesson,_
> _ideally after discussion with their collaborators._
>
> - (ONE, the person who opened the lesson proposal issue - see previous page)
>   Work with the [Curriculum Community Developer][ccd] to ensure
>   your lesson repository is created in [The Carpentries Incubator][incubator].
> - (ALL) Read [Chapter 3: Deciding what to teach][cdh-3] of
>   the Curriculum Development Handbook.
> - (ONE, share the IRL with your collaborators)
>   Make a copy of the [Lesson Design Notes Template][ldn-template-codimd]
>   in your preferred format.
>   You can use this page to record important decisions made about the design of
>   your lesson during and after the Study Groups Program.
> - (ONE) Add a link to your Lesson Design Notes to the Study Group's
>   shared notes document.
> - (ALL) Write at least one learner profile for your lesson
>   and add it to your Lesson Design Notes,
>   making sure your profile(s) answer the questions listed in the chapter.
