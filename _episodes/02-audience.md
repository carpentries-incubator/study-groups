> ## Discussion Prompts
>
> - What did you find challenging about writing learner profiles?
> - What are some of the potential benefits of writing specific learner profiles
>   rather than stopping after answering the _audience definition questions_?
> - What are some of the potential downsides?
> - Did characterising its target audience change how you plan to
>   approach writing your lesson?
> - How many different learner profiles do you think you could write for your lesson?
> - What are some of the challenges of writing a lesson aimed at novices?
> - What are some of the challenges of writing a lesson aimed at people with
>   some prior knowledge of the topic domain
>   e.g. an intermediate programming lesson?

> ## Homework Tasks
>
> _Note for groups of participants collaborating on a single lesson:_
> _**ALL**: a task to be done by all collaborators on a lesson;_
> _**ONE**: a task to be done by only one participant per lesson,_
> _ideally after discussion with their collaborators._
>
> - (ALL) Read [the Technological Introductions chapter of the CDH][cdh-8]
>   and follow the steps to set up your repository as described in
>   the [template README file][incubator-template-readme].
> - (ONE) Read [section A.2 of CDH Appendix A: The Carpentries Incubator][cdh-a1],
>   and add topics to your lesson repository.
>   (If you cannot add the complete set of topic tags yet, do not worry:
>   you will be able to add more and remove topics whenever you like.)
> - (ALL) Note down any questions you have about the lesson template and,
>   if you got stuck, how far you had progressed with the setup beforehand.
> - (ALL) Add a link to your lesson repository to the Study Group's shared notes document.
