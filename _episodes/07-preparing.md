> ## Discussion Prompts
>
> - What feedback do you plan to collect from your learners during the trial run?
>   Is there a particular aspect of your episode that you hope to
>   gather feedback on?
> - How will you and your helper(s) work together during and after the trial run?
> - It is preferable not to teach alone. If you are the sole representative of your
>   lesson in the Study Group, how will your preparations for teaching differ
>   compared to what you do as a member of an instructor team?
> - How long do you expect it will take to teach your trial run of a single episode?
> - What are you looking forward to about the trial run?
> - What do you expect will be challenging?

> ## Homework Tasks
>
> _Note for groups of participants collaborating on a single lesson:_
> _**ALL**: a task to be done by all collaborators on a lesson;_
> _**ONE**: a task to be done by only one participant per lesson,_
> _ideally after discussion with their collaborators._
>
> **Note:** there is a break in the program next week, to allow more time
> for these trial runs to be completed.
>
> - (ALL) If you have not already done so,
>   complete a review of the episode you were assigned.
> - (ALL) Coordinate with the helper(s) you recruited for your Trial Run,
>   to ensure they are prepared to support you in teaching and collecting feedback.
> - (ALL) In a scheduled "Trial Run," teach (at least) one episode of your lesson.
> - (ALL) Open issues on your lesson repository to record the required changes to your lesson that were identified during/after the trial run.
> - (ALL) Before the Study Group next meets, reflect on
>   [the discussion prompts for the next session]({{page.root}}/09-reflecting/).
