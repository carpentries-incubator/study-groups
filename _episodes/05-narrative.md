> ## Discussion Prompts
>
> A frequently encountered problem in lesson development is the conflict
> between using authentic example data sets/tasks and managing the order
> and complexity of the material being taught.
> We are often faced with a choice between
>
> 1. presenting learners with a realistic data set,
>   containing noise and artefacts that may be difficult to account for or remove, or
> 2. using a simplistic or contrived example to provide
>   a sequenced, hierarchical introduction of concepts to manage cognitive load
>
> - Which of these two would you prioritise for your lesson, and why?
> - Did the search for an appropriate data set or example affect the order and/or
>   set of concepts you plan to cover in your lesson?
> - Are there any exercise formats you think would work particularly well for
>   your lesson? Are there any that would work poorly? Explain your reasoning.
