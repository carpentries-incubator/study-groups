> ## Discussion Prompts
>
> A frequently encountered problem in lesson development is the conflict
> between using authentic example data sets/tasks and managing the order
> and complexity of the material being taught.
> We are often faced with a choice between
>
> 1. presenting learners with a realistic data set,
>   containing noise and artefacts that may be difficult to account for or remove, or
> 2. using a simplistic or contrived example to provide
>   a sequenced, hierarchical introduction of concepts to manage cognitive load
>
> - Which of these two would you prioritise for your lesson, and why?
> - Did the search for an appropriate data set or example affect the order and/or
>   set of concepts you plan to cover in your lesson?
> - Are there any exercise formats you think would work particularly well for
>   your lesson? Are there any that would work poorly? Explain your reasoning.

> ## Homework Tasks
>
> _Note for groups of participants collaborating on a single lesson:_
> _**ALL**: a task to be done by all collaborators on a lesson;
> **ONE**: a task to be done by only one collaborator per lesson,
> ideally after discussion with their collaborators._
>
> - (ALL) Recruit one helper for the Trial Run you scheduled last week.
> - (ALL) Read the [Exercise Types chapter of Teaching Tech Together][ttt-exercises].
> - (ALL) Add exercises _of at least three different types_ to your chosen episode page,
>   to assess whether learners have met the objectives for that episode.
> - (ALL) Read [CDH Chapter 5: Developing Content][cdh-5].
> - (ALL) Read [the Expertise and Instruction episode of The Carpentries Instructor Training curriculum][training-expertise].
> - (ALL) Prepare for next week's homework by reading [the Episode Review callout]({{page.root}}/06-content#episode-review) from [the next section]({{page.root}}/06-content/).
