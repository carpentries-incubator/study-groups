> ## Discussion Prompts
>
> - Given its target audience, and the expected duration of the workshops
>   where it will be taught, what level(s) of Bloom's Taxonomy could you
>   expect learners to reach by the end of your lesson?
> - How challenging did you find it to define specific learning objectives
>   for your lesson?
> - Did the process of defining target audience and learning objectives change
>   what you plan to teach in your lesson? If so, how?
> - How do you plan to break your lesson up into episodes, in the context of what
>   you know about short- and long-term memory?
> - Do you think concept maps can be a helpful tool when planning
>   the structure of your lesson?
> - In what other ways, if any, do you plan to make use of concept maps
>   in the development and/or content of your lesson?

> ## Homework Tasks
>
> - Create placeholder files for the other episodes in your lesson.
>   Optionally, add learning objectives to these episode files too.
> - Schedule an opportunity to teach at least one episode of your new lesson.
>   This trial run should take place between sessions 7 and 8
>   (26 March 2021 - 9 April 2021).
>   See the Episode Trial Run callout below for more details.
> - Read [Chapter 4: Designing Challenges][cdh-4] of the [Curriculum Development Handbook][cdh].
> - If your lesson will use an example dataset, in the Data Set section of your Lesson Design Notes
>   briefly describe the features and requirements an ideal dataset would have.
> - Identify at least one appropriate example data set/narrative for your lesson,
>   and add a link to the data set in the shared notes document.
> - In the Data Set section of your Lesson Design Notes, briefly summarise:
>   - why you chose these datasets/examples,
>   - what advantages they have as a tool for learning,
>   - and what disadvantages/difficulties/complexities they would introduce.

> ## Episode Trial Run
>
> Between sessions 7 and 8 of the Study Groups program,
> every lesson developer will teach one of the episodes they have been developing.
> You should choose that episode now.
> Where a lesson has multiple collaborators participating in the program,
> each participant should prepare to teach an episode,
> ideally in the same event as the other trial runs for that lesson.
> Given that you will be teaching it in three or four weeks' time,
> you may want to focus on your chosen episode for the remainder of the Study Groups program.
>
> You can choose the format and audience for this trial run. It could:
>
> - take place online or in-person.
> - be a private session attended by invitation only, or open to external participants.
> - be delivered to members of your own network, community, or institution.
> - be delivered to the other Study Group participants, developers of lessons in [The Carpentries Incubator][incubator], or The Carpentries community as a whole.
>
> However you choose to do it, please make sure you schedule this session as soon a possible.
>
> Feedback and experience collected from testing lesson material like this
> will be most useful if the audience taught closely matches
> the intended audience for the lesson itself.
> However this is often not easy for a short trial run,
> especially if your chosen episode does not appear early in the lesson
> (as audience members will not have benefited from learning the previous episodes first).
> In this case, try to ensure that members of the audience are briefed
> on what kind of feedback to give ([see session 7 for more information](07-preparing/index.html)).
>
> The [Curriculum Community Developer][ccd] can provide support for these sessions.
> For example, by providing access to an account with a paid Zoom license for the trial run,
> by helping advertise the session to The Carpentries (sub)communities,
> by listing sessions on The Carpentries Community Calendar, etc.
