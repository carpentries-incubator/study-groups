> ## Discussion Prompts
>
> - How successful was your trial run?
>   Consider this both from the perspective of the learners -
>   how successfully do you think they learned the skills you were aiming to teach? -
>   and your own -
>   how helpful was the trial run as an exercise in gathering feedback about
>   the ongoing development of your lesson?
> - What worked well about the material you have developed?
> - What needs changing before next time?
>   Consider what needs changing about both the lesson and your approach to teaching it.
> - How well did you estimate how long the episode(s) would take to teach?
> - What do you need help with to improve your lesson?
> - Now that you have followed the process of backwards design from first steps
>   to teaching the new lesson for the first time
>   - what are some benefits of the backwards design approach to lesson development?
>   - what are some of the disadvantages?
> - What do you wish you had known - or that you had been told - when you began developing this lesson?
