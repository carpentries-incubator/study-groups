## Main Texts

During the program, Study Groups will read and discuss a range of resources
relevant to the development of Carpentries lessons.
Two resources central to the program are:

- [The Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook][cdh]
  - Often abbreviated to CDH, the Curriculum Development Handbook provides
  a practical overview of the important steps in lesson development,
  focusing on how those steps relate to the processes and infrastructure
  of The Carpentries.
- [Teaching Tech Together][ttt] by Greg Wilson
  - A more comprehensive review of good practices in lesson development,
  teaching, and community building.

Other resources will be linked throughout the site,
and [the Further Reading page](../further_reading/) lists some recommended resources
for those who wish to explore beyond the program's required reading.

## Weekly Routine

Each week of the program\* includes a set of **reading tasks**,
a one-hour **group discussion session** to reflect on that reading material,
and a set of **homework tasks** designed to help participants
apply the concepts they have read about to the design and development of their lesson.

Participants should try to complete the reading and homework tasks
before the weekly discussion with your group.
We know that you will have many demands on your time and
sometimes it may be difficult to finish everything.
Where you think this may be the case,
please prioritise the reading over other homework tasks,
so you can follow and contribute to the group discussion.

\*there will be a two-week interval between sessions 7 and 8, to allow time for participants to complete a trial run
teaching one of the episodes from their lesson.

## Roles

Every weekly discussion session will have a **Discussion Lead**, a **Notetaker** and one or more **Group Facilitators**.
The roles of the Discussion Lead and the Notetaker will rotate weekly between group participants.

### Discussion Lead

The Discussion Lead is responsible for leading the group through a discussion
of the reading material for this session.
They set the agenda for the discussion
and ensure every group member has an equal opportunity to contribute.
They also take notes when the Notetaker is speaking. The role rotates weekly.

When setting the agenda,
the Discussion Lead might choose to include one or more of
the suggested Discussion Prompts from the episode page for that week,
but they are also free to design their own agenda and
set their own prompts for the discussion.

Discussion Leads may choose to assign timings (5 mins, 10 mins, etc)
to points on the agenda to ensure the discussion keeps moving,
or they may prefer to let the conversation flow more freely.

### Notetaker

The Notetaker is responsible for ensuring that the key points of the discussion are noted.
They may do this all themselves or call for help from others e.g. the Group Facilitator.
It is important that the Notetaker is also able to contribute to the discussion,
so the Discussion Lead should cover notes when the Notetaker is speaking.
The Notetaker is also responsible for adding a copy of the notes
to [the carpentries-incubator/study-groups GitHub repository][study-groups-repo]
before the start of the next session. The role rotates weekly.

### Group Facilitator

The Group Facilitator is a person with experience of
the lesson development process and The Carpentries lesson infrastructure.
One or more Group Facilitators will be present each week to
facilitate the discussions, answer any questions,
and help group participants with the lesson development process.
