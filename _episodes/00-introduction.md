## Main Texts

During the program, Study Groups will read and discuss a range of resources
relevant to the development of Carpentries lessons.
Two resources central to the program are:

- [The Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook][cdh]
  - Often abbreviated to CDH, the Curriculum Development Handbook provides
  a practical overview of the important steps in lesson development,
  focusing on how those steps relate to the processes and infrastructure
  of The Carpentries
- [Teaching Tech Together][ttt] by Greg Wilson
  - A more comprehensive review of good practices in lesson development,
  teaching, and community building.

Other resources will be linked throughout the site,
and [the Further Reading page](further_reading) lists some recommended resources
for those who wish to explore beyond the program's required reading.

## Roles

### Discussion Lead (role rotates weekly)
The Facilitator is responsible for leading the group through a discussion
of the reading material for this session.
They should ensure every group member has an equal opportunity to contribute
to the discussion, and that the discussion is completed in a timely manner.
They also take notes when the Notetaker is speaking.

### Notetaker (role rotates weekly)
Responsible for ensuring that the key points of the discussion are noted. They may do this all themselves or call for help from others e.g. the Group Facilitator. It is important that the Notetaker is also able to contribute to the discussion, so the Discussion Lead should cover notes when the Notetaker is speaking.
The Notetaker also ensures that a copy of the notes is uploaded to the carpentries-incubator/study-groups GitHub repository before the start of the next session.
