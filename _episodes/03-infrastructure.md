> ## Homework Tasks
>
> _Note for groups of participants collaborating on a single lesson:_
> _**ALL**: a task to be done by all collaborators on a lesson;_
> _**ONE**: a task to be done by only one participant per lesson,_
> _ideally after discussion with their collaborators._
>
> - (ALL) Read the [Working with Learning Objectives section of The Carpentries Instructor Training Curriculum][training-LOs].
> - (ALL) Read the [Learning Objectives section of Teaching Tech Together][ttt-LOs].
> - (ALL) Read the [Concept Maps][ttt-maps] and [Seven Plus or Minus Two][ttt-load] sections of Teaching Tech Together.
> - (ALL) In your Lesson Design Notes, write 2-5 learning objectives for your lesson.
> - (ALL) Create at least one episode file in your lesson repository and add 2-4 learning objectives in the `objectives` field for that episode.
> - (ALL, **optional but recommended**) [Set up your computer to build lesson pages locally](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/setup.html#setup-for-local-rendering-of-the-lessons-optional).
>   - Note: setting up a local installation of Jekyll is often not straightforward,
>   but is important to ensure you can make good progress with
>   the development of your lesson.
>   If you run into trouble when following the instructions linked above,
>   please post to the lesson-development Slack channel,
>   create an issue on your lesson repository and mention `@tobyhodges`,
>   email Toby directly,
>   or attend one of the Lesson Template Helpdesk sessions.
